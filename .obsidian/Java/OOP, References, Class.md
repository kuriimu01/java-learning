**Everything (class) can be described by:** 
	properties - властивості - variables
	behaviour - поведінка - methods

## Data hiding
Using private, makes object accessible  only in the class. You can make methods that will return this object inside class, but you can't access it straight. 
### Constructor 
Method, that has a same name with class, did not has a type specificator, and automatically called whenever object is created.
